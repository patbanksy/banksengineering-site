    <h2>Company Overview</h2>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Founded in 2025, Banks Engineering Pty Ltd is a specialist
    engineering consultancy operated by myself (Pat Banks), a qualified engineer
    with extensive experience in mining, civil, and software engineering.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>I specialize in integrated, design-based scheduling, using
    CAD models of earthworks and tunnels to inform project schedules across all
    planning horizons. I also develop targeted software solutions to address
    complex, project-specific challenges as they arise.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>As a sole practitioner, I offer direct, hands-on service and
    maintain full accountability across all stages of project delivery. Clients
    benefit from agile decision-making, consistent expertise, and the flexibility
    to scale through trusted partnerships when required.</p>

    <h2>Core Competencies</h2>

    <h3>Mining</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Design and scheduling, with expertise in hard rock and surface mining.</li>
      <li>Operational and study planning across all planning horizons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Civil</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mass haul modelling, including model federation and quantification.</li>
      <li>Complex tunnel scheduling (e.g., pumped hydro energy storage - PHES).</li>
      <li>Creation of 4D construction models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Development of core commands, plugins, scripts, and process automation tools within the Deswik environment.</li>
      <li>Rapid development of standalone applications to solve specific engineering challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Differentiators</h2>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Unlike most planning consultants, I transitioned into
    full-time software development for several years, building sophisticated tools
    that go far beyond single-function scripts. My hybrid background - combining
    on-site engineering and professional software development - allows me to solve
    technical problems with both depth and relevance.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>This cross-disciplinary expertise enabled me to contribute
    to an R&amp;D initiative focused on adapting industry-leading mining software
    for civil applications. That experience sharpened my understanding of both
    domains and now informs my work building smarter, more adaptable solutions for
    complex infrastructure projects.</p>

    <h2>Track Record</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>4D construction model for a 250MW PHES project (contractor-side).</li>
      <li>4D planning model for a 750MW PHES project (client-side, pre-tender).</li>
      <li>Tool development for optimizing structural shotcrete in blasted tunnels, applied to highway tunnel construction.</li>
      <li>Civil mass haul process with robust quantification, optimization, and reforecasting features (used on wind farms, highways, railways, and airports).</li>
      <li>Road corridor placement tool optimizing cut, fill, and geometry constraints.</li>
      <li>Design, scheduling, and operational analysis of underground mines globally.</li>
      <li>On-site implementation and training for mine planning software.</li>
      <li>Maintenance and deployment of stope optimization and caving tools in Deswik.</li>
      <li>Development of specialized tools, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Rockbolt spacing analysis</li>
          <li>Data drivers</li>
          <li>6DOF mouse support in CAD</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
